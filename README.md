Hi, I'm Xosu Philipp, an Electronics Engineer with a passion for hardware development. While I enjoy programming, my true love lies in designing circuits that I can physically interact with. The thrill of soldering, testing, and debugging in the lab truly feels like coming home.

With over 10 years of experience in the consumer electronics and automotive industries, I specialise in Embedded Systems and Power Electronics. However, I love everything related to electronics.

I hold IPC CID and CID+ certifications, demonstrating my commitment to industry standards and high-quality design practices.

I'm very methodical and focused on the details. When I was a junior engineer, this meticulousness sometimes made me feel self-conscious because it seemed to imply that tasks would take longer. However, experience has shown me that this is a significant strength, preventing many frustrations and costly errors. This attention to detail has proven invaluable for the projects I've worked with by saving considerable time and money. 

Like it or not, this is a defining characteristic of my work 😊.
